##rule

(1)The general(将/帥) is only allowed to take one move per turn, and can move forward, backward, or sideways, but cannot move out of the " palaces". generals are not allowed to directly opposite each other in the same line, if one side has occupied first, the other side must evade, otherwise the general can directly capture the opponent's general without limiting the number of steps.

(2)Each move of the guard (仕/士) is only allowed to take one step along the diagonal line of the "palaces", which can be advanced or retreated.

(3) The Elephant(相/象) cannot cross the "river boundary", and each move is two moves diagonally, which can be advanced or retreated, i.e., the elephant is commonly known as the Elephant's move. When there is another piece in the center of the field, commonly called the eye of the elephant, it does not go over.

(4) The horse(馬/傌) moves one point horizontally or vertically, and then one point diagonally，which can be advanced or retreated, It cannot move in a direction where there is a piece blocking it along the path of movement.

(5) The chariot(車/俥) moves as many points as it wishes horizontally or vertically. It cannot jump over pieces in its path.

(6) When the cannon(炮/砲) captures a piece, it has to jump over only 1 piece but it can be of either side of the target.

(7) Before a pawn(兵/卒) crosses the "river border", it may only move one step forward; after it crosses the "river border", it may move one step forward or one step sideways, but not backward.
